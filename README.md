## BC Rooftop Solar PV Potential

This repository contains the source code for my FCOR 599 project. 

### What is it?

In my project, I'll be mapping the potential of rooftop solar photovoltaic energy across British Columbia. The goal of this project is to provide policymakers and local wavemakers with the information they need to help kick off municipal solar PV projects.
